# RecSys | MovieLens Recommender System

RecSys is a collection of recommendation algorithms applied to the MovieLens ml-100k dataset. It demonstrates various collaborative filtering and machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions.


### :nut_and_bolt: Features
- Multiple algorithms: User-based and item-based collaborative filtering, Matrix Factorization, etc.
- Detailed evaluation using metrics like RMSE and FCP.
- Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step model training and inference.

### :open_file_folder: Usage
- Data Preparation: Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the MovieLens dataset.
- Model Training: Execute the train_model.ipynb notebook to train various models.
- Evaluation: Check best model performance using the evaluate_model.ipynb notebook.
- Inference: Use inference.ipynb for generating movie recommendations.

### :scroll: Algorithms
- Collaborative Filtering: User-based and item-based approaches.
- Matrix Factorization: Techniques like SVD.
- Baseline Models: Compare with simple models such as average rating predictors.

### :test_tube: Installation
To install the RecSys repository, begin by creating and activating a virtual environment to isolate your projectâ€™s dependencies. Next, clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory. Finally, install the required packages specified in the requirements.txt file. This setup ensures you have a clean environment tailored for running the RecSys project effectively.
```
>> python -m venv recsys-env
>> recsys-env\Scripts\activate
```
```
>> git clone https://github.com/goncvlo/RecSys.git
>> cd RecSys
>> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Future Work
- Incorporate deep learning models like Autoencoders.
- Improve scalability for larger datasets.
- Implement a web interface for real-time recommendations.
